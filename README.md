# Housing Repairs Online

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

(see below for Windows setup)

Install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Copy the `example.sentryclirc` file and set the token environment variable in the `.sentryclirc` file to be the auth token in your Sentry account's API settings ([sentry.io](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens) - you will need to have access first):

  ```bash
  cp example.sentryclirc .sentryclirc
  ```

Copy the `example.env` file and set the environment variables in the `.env` file:
  Set the RELEASE_VERSION value to `'mvp'` for the mvp application or any other value for full application.
  Set the environment variables to be local authority details relevant for local development.
  See the documentation [here](https://newarkandsherwood.github.io/housing-repairs-online/front-end/frameworks-used) for more information

  ```bash
  cp example.env .env
  ```

Copy the `cypress.example.env.json` file and set the environment variables in the `cypress.env.json` file to be local authority details relevant for cypress testing:
  
  See the documentation [here](https://newarkandsherwood.github.io/housing-repairs-online/front-end/frameworks-used) for more information

  ```bash
  cp cypress.example.env.json cypress.env.json
  ```

Globally install azure function tools:

  ```bash
  npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 --unsafe-perm true
  ```

In one terminal run the next development server:

  ```bash
  nvm use && yarn dev
  ```

In another terminal run the function server:

Copy the `example.env` file and set the values to point to the repairs API:

```bash
cd api/ && cp example.env .env
```

Start the development function (still in the api directory)

```bash
cd nvm use && yarn start
```

> if the function doesn't start try switching your node version to 14.0.0

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing:
  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) is used for unit testing:
    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```
  - [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) is used for integration testing:
    ```bash
    yarn test:integration
    ```
    to run Cypress tests in headless mode: 
    ```bash
    yarn test:headless:integration
    ```
    to run MVP tests in headless mode:
    ```bash
    yarn test:headless:integration:mvp
    ``` 
## Windows setup:

### Important:

Install commands must be run as admin (in bash preferably to keep the below command syntax)

Install NVM for Windows:

[`Install NodeJS on Windows`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)

Install `win-node-env`:

```bash
npm install -g win-node-env
```

(for more info see [win-node-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/win-node-env))

Note: Environment variables may need to be set manually if the above fails:

System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables

Copy the value of NVM_HOME in the admin user to the value of NVM_HOME in the System variables

  After installing NVM, global utilities (e.g. yarn) will have to be reinstalled for each installed version of node:

  ```bash
    nvm use 16.0.0
    npm install -g yarn
    nvm use 14.16.1
    npm install -g yarn
    ```

(for more info see [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installationâ€”upgrades))

Install all dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

(run as admin in the `main` directory and then again in the `api` directory)

You can now continue with the instructions above.

## Look and feel

The app can be deployed using original
[Gov.uk design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/)
styles or using Lincoln.gov styles.

## General note dump

--------------------

- Testing:
  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) is used for unit testing:

    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```
  
  - [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) is used for integration testing:
  
    ```bash
    yarn test:integration
    ```

- Local dev
  https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli

- M1 Macs setup:
  - You may need to use node 14.0.0. Install this using

    ```bash
    nvm install v14.0.0
    ```

    and then run

    ```bash
    nvm use 14.0.0 && yarn dev
    ```

  - If there is an error about a missing binding try rebuilding sass:

    ```bash
    npm rebuild node-sass
    ```

    and then re-run the web server:

    ```bash
    nvm use 14.0.0 && yarn dev
    ```

  - If you get this error message when running the web server:

    ```bash
    Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X Unsupported architecture (arm64)
    ```

    In package.json set the version of sass to 6.0.0:

      ```bash
      "node-sass": "^6.0.0",
      ```

    Then rebuild sass before re-running the web server as above.
